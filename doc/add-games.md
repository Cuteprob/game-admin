The gameplay of Catch The Goose
There are over 50 levels to play in this thinking game, so start with the first one. You get a basket in front of you, and random foods are dropped into it. Each fruit and vegetable has at least three in the basket, so you can match them all. Click on an item to drop it into your hotbar at the bottom, and when 3 of the same items are there, they match! Your hotbar only has space for 7 items, keep that in mind. When there are 7, and they don’t match, you get a game over and have to start over the level.

Match all the items in the basket to complete the level. Later on, geese appear as well. You just have to match them, good luck finding them! Can you complete all 50 levels, as well as the challenges? Find out in Catch The Goose.

How to play: 
1. Tap three identical items to eliminate them.
2. Complete all eliminations to capture the goose.
