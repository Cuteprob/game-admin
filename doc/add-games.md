Disturbing visuals and unsettling atmosphere push every choice closer to the edge. Step into this unsettling journey, embrace the darkness, and see how far you’re willing to go for survival.

Story Beneath the Clicks
Released on August 2, 2025, on itch.io, this is a simulation game crafted by SHROOMYCHRIST. A grim tale unfolds in pastel tones, hiding cruelty beneath its colors. Faced with desperation, a simple deal becomes the path to salvation—or damnation. What begins to survive turns into a psychological descent, leaving behind a lingering question of how far anyone would go when time runs out.

Follow these basic instructions to understand the main mechanics of BLOODMONEY! before diving into the step-by-step gameplay guidelines.

Attack the main character, Harvey, continuously to earn money, with each painful action escalating the dark humor and visual chaos on screen.
Purchase increasingly brutal upgrades that intensify Harvey’s suffering while multiplying profits, creating a twisted balance between cruelty and financial gain.
Strategically manage upgrades to maximize earnings, watching the bizarre transformation of Harvey as damage compounds with each improvement.
Unlock unique endings based on your upgrade path, revealing different fates for Harvey shaped by your ruthless or cautious strategy.
Experience one of three main endings with all your previous decisions: Good Ending, Bad Ending, or Normal Ending.
