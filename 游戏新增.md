  Become a swinging man in an appealing spin-off of Stickman Hook! Defy gravity with acrobatic flair in the exhilarating skill game Stick Hook!

Stick Hook: The Ultimate Aerial Adventure Challenge!
Put your ultimate navigation and gravity control to the test with Stick Hook! This game will require you to demonstrate exquisite skill and absolute concentration, making it impossible to take your eyes off the screen for even a second. With impressive jumps and hooks, you will face unexpected fluctuations, pushing your limits to new heights.

You will accompany a brave stickman, perform spectacular rope climbs and overcome all challenges. Each level of this game is designed to challenge your control and acumen, from complex obstacles to treacherous terrain.

Stick Hook’s journey to clear all levels has begun! Get ready to become one of the number-one adventurers with your divine skills. Jump into the game now and prove you are the master of ultimate hooks!

The Game for Skilled Players
This entertaining game requires skill and smart strategies and is not a good choice for players who give up easily. First of all, you should be very patient to be willing to play again and again. Players also need to diversify strategies (when necessary) to experiment until they overcome any level. However, if you still feel this game is suitable for you, let’s explore it in more detail!

Grasp the Bouncing, Jumping, and Swing Gameplay
Understand the Game Rules
Stick Hook has a core game rule that couldn’t be simpler: guide the character to swing to the finish line. However, conquering the levels in this game will not be easy. Besides the hook attachment points, the jumping pads are both an opportunity and an obstacle. When in a falling state, your character will be a ball. When connected to any hook, the stickman will appear in its true form. Both of these character states operate based on physics. Therefore, controlling the falling point and aligning the swing of the rope is extremely important.

The game has no time limit but you will be in trouble if you don’t push the stickman to the next hook position. You won’t be able to see the entire terrain during most rounds. Therefore, be cautious in every move. Pay special attention to the arrangement of the jumping pads to make effective use of them, in addition to using hooks. The next level in Stick Hook will open in turn when you complete the tasks in the previous round.
Navigate Your Stickman
Your character in Stick Hook will be dropped at any point in the air. You need to quickly locate the first hook that the stickman can reach. Usable hooks will have a border around them. Then, hold down the mouse button to let the character throw the rope to the pivot point. Pay attention to the swaying movement of the stickman to choose a reasonable release point and continue the same operations. If you want to release the string, simply release your finger from the command key.

Master the Art of Airborne Acrobatics
For a game of skill like Stick Hook, mastering the round will be a bit difficult. However, there are still tips and tricks for you to master the art of airborne acrobatics. Of course, you can absolutely come up with your own strategies and experiment. Or, refer to some of the following suggestions to (possibly) win in less time:

Tap to grab the hook as you’re moving down and release when you have reached the highest point. This helps you fly farther and avoid touching the ground.
Note that you will not necessarily use all the hooks available. Based on real-life situations, to quickly improve tactics.
Observe the stickman’s flight direction before releasing the hook so you can choose the next landing point accurately.
Use your character’s inertia, take advantage of pulling and pushing to move more smoothly through obstacles. Don’t panic when encountering difficult obstacles. Calmly observe and try to grab the nearest hook to pass.
Circular movement skills are also important in Stick Hook. Practice so that the character can spin correctly and reach the desired height. Understanding how your character reacts to objects in the game will help you predict and maneuver movement better.
Some levels may not be passed easily on the first try because you don’t know the terrain. Then do not hesitate to move forward to explore map design and develop conquest strategies.
Last but not least, patience and practice are key. Each play is an opportunity for you to improve your skills and get a higher score.
Unlock Numerous Achievement and Awards
There are two types of rewards in Stick Hook: level-based rewards and weekly rewards. The valuable gifts in this game are the lovely skins of the characters. Not just a stickman, you can also accompany tiny beans, cute foods, magic potions, etc.

For level-based skins, players will gradually unlock this reward when completing a certain number of rounds. Meanwhile, each week you will be able to choose one of the available skins to thicken your character collection. Are you confident you have enough patience and skill to own a full set of unique characters in this game?

  Description:
 Ovo: Cracking the Code of Creative Collaboration

Ovo, a mobile game developed by the Finnish studio Neon Giant, has taken the gaming world by storm with its unique blend of action, puzzle-solving, and creative collaboration.

A Symphony of Light and Sound:

Ovo plunges players into a surreal world where vibrant, geometric shapes dance and pulsate to the rhythm of a captivating soundtrack. Your task: to manipulate these shapes using a simple touch interface, guiding them through intricate levels and unraveling their hidden secrets.

The Art of Collaboration:

But here's where Ovo truly shines. The game isn't just about individual skill; it's about fostering a spirit of collaboration. Ovo features a unique "synchronization" mechanic, where two players can join forces to complete levels. Players need to work together, anticipating each other's moves and coordinating their actions to navigate obstacles and solve puzzles. This adds a layer of strategic depth and creates a truly unique gameplay experience.

More than just a Game:

Ovo isn't simply about winning; it's about the journey. The game's mesmerizing visuals and evocative soundtrack create an immersive atmosphere that draws players into its world. The emphasis on collaboration encourages communication and teamwork, fostering a sense of shared accomplishment.

A Game for Everyone:

Ovo is a game for everyone, regardless of experience level. Its intuitive controls and accessible gameplay make it easy to pick up and enjoy, while its depth and challenge keep players engaged. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or a casual player looking for something new, Ovo has something to offer.

The game itself will guide you in the first levels to adapt to controls. However, it would help to learn these tips before starting.
Controls are like in any other arcade game. You should use the arrow keys to move. You can jump by pressing up or the spacebar. On the other hand, OvO stickman has several special movements that are more than running and jumping. These movements are diving, smashing and sliding. Learn about them below.
Diving: Jumping will save you from small obstacles and holes. But more is needed for big ones. When facing a long cavity or obstacle to jump over, you need to dive. You can dive by pressing the down arrow key while jumping. Diving is a short fly in the air, just like how chickens fly.
Smashing: Checked floors can be smashed when you need to go down. In order to smash a floor, first jump and press down.
Sliding: You may need to go under some of the obstacles. Slide under them by pressing down arrow key while running.
You can change your skin in the main menu and slay with your style. Our favorite skin is "MaterWelon OVO". Give that suit a chance. 
As of 2023, there are 9 sections consisting of 61 levels in total, and still growing. These sections are Basic, Mechanics, Getting Serious, Higher Order, OvO Space Program, Journey through the Portal, Community Levels, The Gauntlet and Traning Level. 
You may choose to challenge yourself to complete a section in a shorter time and beat your own record.
Tips for Difficult OvO Levels
OvO is not just a parkour game. As you level up, some levels require puzzle-solving skills as well. You need to figure out which path is less risky and doable.
Since OvO is a fast-paced skill game, you might fail in the first trials. But don't worry, you will get used to the mechanics in a short time.
If you are really stuck with a level, you may get help by watching walkthroughs. There are many OvO fans out there to help you out with this!
- how to play:
  Press up arrow to move up
Use down arrow to move down
Use left arrow to move left
Use right arrow to move right
Use the Spacebar to jump
Press R to restart the level
